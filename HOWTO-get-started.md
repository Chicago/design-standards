## How we created the pattern library for the Chicago Design System.

1. (for Mac) treehouse install stuff for each
2. npm install stuff
3. gulp install stuff https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/docs/getting-started.md
4. Hey, you don't need to install Gulp.... so...
5. "npm install @pattern-lab/core" from https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/core


Install Node.
Install Gulp.

You could probably avoid installing Gulp, to be honest.

Then I tried to npm install @pattern-lab/core. That worked so long as I was in the root of my user directory. Elsewhere, like in a folder to start a github repo, not so much.

So, instead I forked https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node

npm i @pattern-lab/core
npm i @pattern-lab/uikit-workshop
npm i @pattern-lab/engine-mustache


I removed Gulp.

## Attempt 37

0. Install homebrew.
1. Install node: brew install etc.



Okay, then:

bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
