## How To Get Started with the Chicago Design System.

## GitHub

1. Navigate to the Chicago Design System repositoryâ€™s *Code* tab [here](https://github.com/Chicago/design-system).
2. Click *Clone or download*.
3. Copy the URL provided.
4. Open your command line or Terminal application and enter the directory where you would like to copy the repository. This can be anywhere in your local file system, like your home directory. For example:
> cd ~/
5. Clone the repository by replacing <URL> with clone URL you copied in the previous step. The repository will be cloned into a new directory in this location.
> git clone <URL>
6. Navigate into the directory of the repository you just created. Replace with your own repository's name.
> cd <REPOSITORY-NAME>
7. Type:
> git status
git status is a command you will use often to verify the current state of your repository and the files it contains. Right now, we can see that we are on branch master, everything is up to date with origin/master and our working directory is clean.

## Jekyll

### Mac Install

(Go here)[https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/] for instructions on how to install Jekyll

Once Jekyll is installed, navigate to design-system/docs and run the command:

> bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''

You can then pull up http://localhost:4000/ in your browser to see the design standards

## Pattern Lab

1. (for Mac) treehouse install stuff for each
2. npm install stuff
3. gulp install stuff https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/4.0/docs/getting-started.md
4. Hey, you don't need to install Gulp.... so...
5. "npm install @pattern-lab/core" from https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node/tree/master/packages/core


Install Node.
Install Gulp.

You could probably avoid installing Gulp, to be honest.

Then I tried to npm install @pattern-lab/core. That worked so long as I was in the root of my user directory. Elsewhere, like in a folder to start a github repo, not so much.

So, instead I forked https://github.com/pattern-lab/patternlab-node

npm i @pattern-lab/core
npm i @pattern-lab/uikit-workshop
npm i @pattern-lab/engine-mustache


I removed Gulp.

## Attempt 37

0. Install homebrew.
1. Install node: brew install etc.
