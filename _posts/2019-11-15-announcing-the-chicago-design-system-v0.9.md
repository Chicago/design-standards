excerpt: Announcing a pre-release version of the Chicago Design System for community feedback.

The Chicago Design System (CDS) is the design system for the people and government of the City of Chicago. It has been produced by policy-makers, technologists, designers, visionaries, and moreâ€“all people like you.

I am pleased to announce v0.9 of the Chicago Design System has been released for community feedback prior to launch. See [design.chicago.gov](https://design.chicago.gov/) for more details, and the [quick start](https://design.chicago.gov/start/) to get started.

Thanks to everyone in the [credits](https://design.chicago.gov/credits) for their contributions to the public good.

In any project spanning two years and administrations to get to version 0.9, a village doesn't cut it. It takes a city.

Thank you, Chicago, for all you are and all you can be.
