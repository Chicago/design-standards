excerpt: Announcing a pre-release version of the Chicago Design System for community feedback.
---

I am please to announce v0.9 of the Chicago Design System has been released for community feedback prior to release. See [design.chicago.gov](https://design.chicago.gov/) for more details, and the [quick start](https://design.chicago.gov/start/) to get started.

Thanks to everyone in the [credits](https://design.chicago.gov/credits) for their contributions to the public good.

In any project spanning two years and administrations to get to version 0.9, a village doesn't cut it. It takes a city.

Thank you, Chicago, for all you are and all you can be.
