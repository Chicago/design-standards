Lukas Hoffman has been a most excellent intern for The City of Chicago's Department of Innovation and Technology during the summer of 2018. Learn a little more about Lukas in his own words:

I am a current student and rising senior at Northside College Preparatory High School, a Chicago Public School that participates in the system’s Career and Technical Education Program, through which I am interning at DoIT this summer. I’m only here for 6 weeks before going back to school in the fall, but my goal is to apply the skills I’ve learned in school along with new techniques acquired from my work with Jason and the Design Team, furthering my practical knowledge.

I plan to major in computer science and Japanese language when I go to college, and these have been my main focuses in school. This summer I’m learning a lot about web programming and design, while I’ve focused more on hard computer science and computer engineering in the classroom. Last summer, I was a Japan-America Friendship Scholar, and was able to experience a 6-week exchange to Nagoya, Japan. 

I’m very excited to be working here at the Department of Innovation and Technology, and I hope that I can make real contributions to the Chicago Design System, and consequently the city as a whole.
