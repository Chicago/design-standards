## Design & imagery

The Chicago Design System theme was developed in pro bono partnership with [Ogilvy](https://ogilvy.com/), and type designer Patric King of [House of Pretty](https://xo.houseofpretty.com). Typefaces Big Shoulders (coming soon!), [Saira](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Saira), [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto), and [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora) are hosted on Google fonts 

Many of the images appearing on City of Chicago websites are a product of the Department of Fleet and Facility Management's <a href="https://chicago.gov/content/city/en/depts/dgs/provdrs/asset_management.html" target="_self" title="Bureau of Asset Management">Bureau of Asset Management</a>.

Prints are available to buy online at the [Chicago Image Gallery](https://chicagoimagegallery.cityofchicago.org/).
