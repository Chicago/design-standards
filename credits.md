The Chicago Design System (CDS) is the design system for the people and government of the City of Chicago. It has been produced by policy-makers, technologists, designers, visionaries, and moreâ€“all people like you.

Work began early in 2018 as a unique collaboration between the Mayor's Office, the Department of Innovation & Technology, and the Department of Fleet and Facility Management. Team leads Grace Cheung, Danielle DuMerer, Alberto Ferrari, and Jason Kunesh worked in pro bono partnership with [Ogilvy](https://ogilvy.com/)'s Chicago office and local type designer Patric King of [House of Pretty](https://xo.houseofpretty.com). Throughout the process we have relied upon partners inside and outside government to make this work.

In any project spanning two years and administrations just to get to implementation, a village doesn't cut it. It takes a city.
