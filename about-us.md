At the design office, we work to make city services more accessible and inclusive for Chicago residents. It’s our mission to listen, amplify, and design with the community to build better technology experiences for everyone. 

## What we do

Digital designers with the City of Chicago:

* Provide design resources and expertise on UX projects within city government.
* Champion accessibility across City digital products and services in partnership with the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities.
* Improve City resources through projects like redesigning the [311 portal](https://311.chicago.gov) and the [Chicago Design System](https://chicagodesignsystem.org).
* Engage with residents through user-centered research and by making digital content.

## Who we are

The Department of Innovation & Technology's Design Office was established in 2018. We stand on the shoulders of giants like [USDS](https://www.usds.gov/), [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/), NYC’s [Gov Lab](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doitt/html/govlabstudio/index.html) and [Service Design Studio](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/opportunity/portfolio/service-design-studio.page), [de Waag in Amsterdam](https://waag.org/), [the Lab at OPM](https://lab.opm.gov/), [the United Kingdom’s Digital Services team](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service), and more. 

As a new design team, we are lucky to have great examples of how design thinking and innovation work within government. It gives us the opportunity to learn from those who came before and partner with them to break new ground in civic tech.

#### Abby Lammers
Abby is an intern with the Design Office for the summer of 2019. As an intern, Abby is helping to introduce the Design Office and the [new design system](https://chicagodesignsystem.org) to the world, as well as assisting with UX design and research for the data science team. Abby is currently studying human-centered design in Northwestern University's M.S. Engineering Design Innovation program. She hopes that her work with DoIT and the Design Office will be her first opportunity of many to use design to give back to her adopted hometown of Chicago.
