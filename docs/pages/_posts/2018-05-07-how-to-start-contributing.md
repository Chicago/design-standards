## How To Contribute to the Chicago Design System.

This quick start guide will walk you through cloning the GitHub repository, as well as installing  Jekyll and Pattern Lab so you can start contributing to the Chicago Design System. Once you've made edits to your local forks, you can submit a pull request through git/GitHub, which may be merged with the main project after review.

You can get involved by giving us feedback, [writing an issue](https://github.com/Chicago/design-system/issues/new), or [finding other ways to contribute](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).

We communicate about this project in our [CDS Slack workspace](https://chicagodesignsystem.slack.com/messages). Request an invitation by emailing us at [Chicago Design System](mailto:design.system@cityofchicago.org) or using our [shared invite link](https://join.slack.com/t/chicagodesignsystem/shared_invite/enQtMzM2OTA4MTQyNzIzLWVlOWFkOWQ4YWE0NWQ2YTAzOTFmYWFlMGVjNTEwZjA5ZWNmYjFkZTNhNDNhMmM1MTJiYmQ3MDk2NWZkNzg2Mjg).

2. In the top-right corner of the page, click **Fork**.
3. You now have a forked copy of the original /Chicago/design-system repository. The next step is to make a local copy to edit.
4. Go to the **code** section of your fork.
5. Clock **Clone or download**
6. Copy the URL provided.
7. Open your command line or Terminal application and enter the directory where you would like to copy the repository.
8. Clone the repository with the command below by replacing `<URL>` with the fork URL you copied in the previous step. The repository will be cloned into a new directory in this location.
```
git clone <URL>
```
9. Navigate into the directory of the repository you just created with the command below.
```
cd design-system
```

## Jekyll

Jekyll is used to publish the Chicago Design System. You will need to install Jekyll in order to preview your changes to the main CDS repository site.

#### Mac Install

[Go here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/quickstart/) for instructions on how to install Jekyll.

Once Jekyll is installed, navigate to the docs folder in the design-system respository and run:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl ''
```

You can then pull up http://localhost:4000/ in your browser to see the design standards local clone.

## Pattern Lab

Pattern Lab is used to publish the atomic design elements of the Chiago Design System. You will need to install the CDS Pattern Lab fork in order to edit and preview your changes to the CDS pattern library. [Go here](http://patternlab.io/) for more information on Pattern Lab and atomic design.
