## Web addresses

- Upper case can be used in web addresses (URL) if officially promoted that way,
otherwise use all lower-case for visible web addresses

- For city emails, field should contain full public address. (such as

- Email address should be all lower case unless email is promoted in a case specific
manner. (All city emails are lower case.)
    - Examples:

## Links

- In writing, web visible link text should exclude “http://” but may include www if needed.
Actual URLs should always include Error! Hyperlink reference not valid.
Example:
www.cityofchicago.org
- Links should not be bold unless it is also considered a keyword selected to be bold.
- Web links should be used selectively, and kept short.
- Links may be added in body copy as needed. Keep target set at “_BLANK” for all non-city
web pages.

- When linking text, link from a noun, noun phrase (or in some cases a verb) that may be
read as a keyword or indicator to the subject matter.
- Multiple sentences or paragraphs should not be used as links.
