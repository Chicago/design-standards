Accessibility is an essential aspect of web development for the City of Chicago. With nearly ten million people in the Chicago metropolitan area, and millions of visitors each year, accessibility means the greatest number of users can view our content.

In general, the City of Chicago follows [WCAG2.0 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) as our standard for accessibility. All patterns, styles, and color combinations in the Pattern Library have been tested to comply with this standard.
