Jokes that resemble the above, such as &#39;hipster racism&#39;, still count as harassment even if meant satirically or ironically. See [this article](http://www.racialicious.com/2012/05/02/a-historical-guide-to-hipster-racism/) for background.

- &quot;Reverse&quot;-isms, including &quot;reverse racism,&quot; &quot;reverse sexism,&quot; and &quot;cisphobia&quot;
- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as &quot;leave me alone,&quot; &quot;go away,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not discussing this with you.&quot;
- Communicating in a &quot;tone&quot; you don&#39;t find congenial
- Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions
