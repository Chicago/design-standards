The CDS is designed to give a look and feel that is not only emblematic of Chicago's intricate design history, but one that is modern, clean, and accessible. Our colors and fonts are taken straight from Chicago icons like the seal and the flag, but have also been checked for accessibility ratings. The styling of the CDS will help give Chicago sites an instantly recognizable and familiar look while maintaining core design principles.
