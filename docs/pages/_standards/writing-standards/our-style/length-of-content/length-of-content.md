- Ensure that sentences and paragraphs are a suitable length for web reading. Generally
paragraphs should contain 50 words or less.
- The average number of words on a single content page should be around 500-600
words or less. Content that greatly exceeds this limit should be divided into multiple
pages or by layering pages.
- Headers should be concise and include keywords that refer to the topic. Most headers
should be 8 words or less. A good header will make it easier to find your content. In
some cases header also service as Page titles. Titles should be up to 64 characters in
length, but shorter is often better. Remember to use headers “in order” for accessibility
purposes (h1, followed by h2, then h3, etc.)
