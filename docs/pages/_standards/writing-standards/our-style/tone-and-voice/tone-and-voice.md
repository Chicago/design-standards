- Site visitors expect web content to be less formal than print content.
- Use a tone that is informal while still maintaining professionalism.
- Content may use the first person when speaking of the department (we or us) and use
the second person when referring to the reader.
    - Example: The Department of Public Health is here to serve you. We protect health, foster self reliance, and protect the vulnerable in numerous ways. To get a flu shot, visit your nearest clinic.
