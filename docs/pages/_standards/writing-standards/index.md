The City of Chicago uses plain language when communicating with the public. Plain language is straightforward. It avoids fluff, exaggeration and buzz words. It uses inclusive, gender neutral language that considers broad audiences. It is clear and easy to scan. And most of all it addresses your audience's needs first.

The best communication is always a person-to-person interaction. Plain language strives to make reading simple, but doesn't condescend.

This guide will cover the voice and style to be used across all City of Chicago department content.
