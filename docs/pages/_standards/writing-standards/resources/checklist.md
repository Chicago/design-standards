- Use plain language.
- Avoid fluff, exaggeration and buzz words.
- Users should understand what is written the first time they read or hear it.
- Use logical organization with the reader in mind.
- Use "you" and other pronouns.
- Always write in an active voice.
- Use short sentences and common, everyday words.
- Avoid the use of technical jargon.
- Always write instructions in the affirmative. Tell visitors to do something, rather than
telling them not to do something else.
- Avoid the use of metaphors and other figurative language.
- Use gender neutral language. Avoid constructions that might be interpreted by some
readers as an unnecessary reinforcement of traditional stereotypes or inherently convey
a particular sex.

- Do not use a masculine or feminine pronoun to refer to a generic/hypothetical persons
or groups.
- Examples:
    - Letter carrier (not mailman)
    - Firefigher (not fireman)
    - Server (not Waitress)
    - Host (not Hostesses)
    - Actor (not Actresses)
    - Chairperson or Chair (not chairman)
    - Spokesperson (not chairman)
    - Flight Attendant (not stewardess)
    - Police Officer (not policeman)
- Avoid uncommon gender-marked terms (conductress, career woman, male nurse) as it
may appear to implicate that the subject's gender is uncommon, unexpected or
somehow inappropriate
- Do not use non-parallel expressions (man and wife rather than "husband and
wife"). Another example of lack of parallelism would be the use of first names
for women and last names for men within in the same content.
