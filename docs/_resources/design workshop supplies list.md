## Butcher paper

So, I need some butcher paper to hang on walls so we can white board and then take that work to go.


* At Office Depot, this is crazy expensive:
[Office Depot速 Brand Unbleached Butcher Paper Roll, 36", Kraft](https://www.officedepot.com/a/products/938042/Office-Depot-Brand-Unbleached-Butcher-Paper/) (1,000 ft. Length) $120.

* [PACON CORPORATION BUTCHER PAPER NATURAL 36IN X 100FT](https://www.amazon.com/Pacon-0066011-Natural-Kraft-Wrapping/dp/B077GNXV6B/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1519159752&sr=8-4&keywords=butcher+paper+roll+36+inch)
I don't know if I'm looking at the wrong kind or something, but I don't need food grade whatever, just 36" x 100' (and like 10 of 'em) or 36" x 1000' (much less portable, tho).
* [School Smart 40 lb Paper Roll - 36 inches x 1000 feet - Brown](https://www.amazon.com/School-Smart-40-Paper-Roll/dp/B003U6OWZ0/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1519159752&sr=8-8&keywords=butcher+paper+roll+36+inch) about $42.
