By [https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:-xfi-](User XFI (!?!)) - according to a design specified by [Wikipedia user John Reid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:John_Reid) or [T. E. Whalen's](http://introvert.net/blog/2004/04/17/what-is-the-deal-with-the-stars-on-the-chicago-flag/)) construction sheet ([Municipal Flag of Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Municipal_Flag_of_Chicago)), which is in the public domain, and thus represented here.

For more details on the history of the flag, see [Robert Loerzel](https://twitter.com/robertloerzel)'s wonderfully comprehensive [The Story of Chicagoâ€™s Four-Star City Flag](https://medium.com/@robertloerzel/the-story-of-chicagos-four-star-city-flag-4042dc579cb2).

[Tanner Woodford](https://tannerwoodford.com/), Executive Director of the [Design Museum of Chicago](https://designchicago.org/), had this contribution to share with us, an outline of the dimensions of the Flag:

I don't mean to disagree or spark debate, but I think Robert & Tanner & T.E. may need to compare notes with us at the City and arrive at a final determination. I volunteer to mediate it in 2020 or beyond, or find someone with appropriate gravitas to do so, certainly.
